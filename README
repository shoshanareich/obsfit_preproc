1. Open filenames_hourly_map.ipynb and specify the swot cycles and directory. Then run the scriptto create text file, which lists the python commands to execute.
2. qsub submit_swot_regridding.sh
	a. this runs the regridding script for each pass in the specified cycles
	b. output files will be in /nobackup/sreich/swot/swot_obsfit_L3/ 
3. Combine swot hourly files by running merge_files.ipynb

TO-DO:
- use better uncertainty than 0.02 
- fix where uncertainty is set (currently in both swot_to_obsfit_final.py and merge_files.ipynb)
